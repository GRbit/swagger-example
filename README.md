This repo is for lecture+practicum on API specification and design.

The lecture is about API, different types of API specifications, and how to design API.

Instead of slides I just use a set of browser tabs with different resources.
Here it is https://www.one-tab.com/page/oEkDq0cPRGamLwsgtUC0Gw

A brief summary of discussed spec types is here https://cryptpad.disroot.org/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/kKYa0ONYUT6Dys38Wf8ubkNh/

Sorry, but no further description is available ;-)

Read the code, propose any changes, and have fun!
